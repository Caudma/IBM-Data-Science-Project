Hello everyone!

This is my first project on Github. In my case this project is part of the IBM Data Science professional certificate I am trying to get. This project consists of Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data
such as data from TESLA, Apple, GameStop.... This document is not intended to draw conclusions or make decisions, it is focused on obtaining and cleansing the Stock/Revenue Data from different 
companies for later visualization.
